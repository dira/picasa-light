h2. Technicalities

picasa-light is built on top of Sinatra using the Picasa Web Albums Data API.

The images are loaded progressively via Javascript, 4 at a time, in order not to choke the viewer's browser.

The interface is inspired by "a minimalist Flickr viewer":http://ihardlyknowher.com/. I use CSS for showing details only on the 'active' picture, and some Javascript for the click-to-zoom feature.
